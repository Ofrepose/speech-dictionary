# Python Speech Recognition Software with Keyword Overlays

This Python speech recognition software is designed to enhance video call experiences by listening for specific keywords from a library. When the software detects a keyword, it overlays the definition and example of the keyword on the screen, providing real-time context and information to the user.

## Features

- Listens to Audio: Captures audio from video calls to analyze speech.
- Keyword Detection: Detects keywords from a predefined library in real-time.
- Definition Overlay: Overlays the definition and example of the detected keyword.
- Interactive GUI: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
- Multilingual Support: Utilizes Vosk model for speech recognition in different languages.
- AI Question Answering: Uses AI to answer questions based on user input.
- Customizable Libraries: Supports custom keyword libraries for various topics.
